        Data and Methodology
    </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The rental areas displayed are groups of 2001 census area units, the same groups used by Tenancy Services'
            <a href='https://www.tenancy.govt.nz/rent-bond-and-bills/market-rent/'>
                market rent calculator.
            </a>
        </li>
        <li>
            The median gross annual incomes of employed Aucklanders, Wellingtonians, etc. comes from Statistics New Zealand from
            <a href='http://www.stats.govt.nz/browse_for_stats/income-and-work/Income/NZIncomeSurvey_HOTPJun15qtr.aspx'>
                the June 2015 income survey.
            </a>
        </li>
        <li>
            Rents come from the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE)
            <a href='http://www.mbie.govt.nz/info-services/housing-property/sector-information-and-statistics/rental-bond-data'>
                rental bond data.
            </a>
            The rents displayed are geometric mean rents per dwelling size and come from the last six months. MBIE says that the distribution of rents per dwelling size is approximately log-normal, so that the geometric mean rent is a good approximation to the sample median rent. The rental bond data does not include actual sample median rents.
        </li>
        <li>
            Commute distances and times come from the quickest paths through the street network between rental area sample points. They were calculated with the Google Maps API for departures at 2017-06-01 07:30:00 and include estimated congestion delays.
        </li>
        <li>
            Commute costs per kilometer come from [MaMo2014, Table 2] and are (walk, bicycle, car) = (0, 0, $0.274). Public transport costs were estimated from card fares for journeys between rental area sample points using
            <a href='https://at.govt.nz/bus-train-ferry/journey-planner/'>
                the Auckland Transport journey planner,

            and

                the Christchurch Metro fare zones.
            </a>
        </li>
        <li>
            Car ownership cost per car per year comes from [MaMo2014, Table 3] and is $2228.
