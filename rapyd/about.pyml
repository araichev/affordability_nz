    p:
        "That depends on your financial targets. For example, if you  want to live frugally"
        a(href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2011/10/06/the-true-cost-of-commuting/"):
            "like Mr. Money Mustache,"
        "then you want to save at least 65% of your net income, leaving at most 35% for expenses. Some of that needs to go to food, clothing, healthcare, etc., leaving roughly 20% of net income for rent and commutes."
    b:
        "Why not include other costs in the app, such as food, power, and internet?"
    p:
        "We want to emphasize the spatial nature of affordability and balance accuracy with simplicity, informing but not overwhelming the user. So we include the dominant and most spatially variable costs and exclude the rest, such as food, power, and internet."
    b:
        "Why not display the 2001 census area units found in the MBIE rental bond data instead of aggregating them into larger areas?"
    p:
        "Two reasons. First, the MBIE data is spotty, so you would see a lot of gray census area units with no rental data. Aggregating them improves the data coverage, albeit at the loss of spatial resolution. Second, aggregating as we do allows you to compare the map directly with the Tenancy Services

            "market rent calculator,"
        "should you want more details on market rent, such as rent quartiles."

        "That site is archived"
        a(href="http://affordability-nz-2013.mrcagney.works"):
            "here."
        "It has more complete rental data from the 2013 census and finer spatial resolution but is stuck in time in 2013. That is because its high quality data will not be available again until after the next New Zealand census, which takes place March 2018."
